# Conflict Plan

**What will your group do when it encounters conflict?**

Speak up and resolve the issue in the moment. If the moment passes, for some reason, speak up THAT day (or the next morning's standup if it happens in the evening) during the time alloted in the evening standup meeting.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

We will tackle this head on and bring up the issue right away in a respectful manner. We will allow space for the individual to share any concerns or barriers they may have to contributing fully to the project.

**What is your process to resolve conflicts?**

We will endeavor to build consensus first and foremost. However, if consensus cannot be attained, we will rely upon majority opinion. Once a decision is made, we will each commit to fully embracing the idea/direction.

**How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?**

We will decide, as a group, to involve a member of the instructional team to act as a mediator.
